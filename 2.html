          César Azpilicueta Tanco (Spanish pronunciation: [ˈθesaɾ aθpiliˈkweta ˈtaŋko]; born 28 August 1989) is a Spanish professional footballer who captains Premier League club Chelsea and plays for the Spain national team primarily as a full back but also as a centre back. A youth product of Osasuna, he spent three seasons in La Liga before switching to Marseille, winning four major honours with the French club. In the summer of 2012, he moved to Chelsea, winning the Europa League in his first season and a domestic double two years later. He has made over 350 appearances for the club, winning the Europa League again as captain in 2019. Azpilicueta earned 55 caps for Spain at youth level in all age groups, and represented the under-21s in two European Championships, winning the 2011 edition. He made his first appearance with the full side in 2013 and was selected for two World Cups as well as Euro 2016.
